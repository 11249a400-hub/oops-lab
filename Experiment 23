Experiment 23
 Single Inheritance in C++

Aim:

To implement Single Inheritance in C++, where one derived class inherits the properties of one base class.

Algorithm:

1. Start the program.
2. Create a Base Class that contains data members and a function.
3. Create a Derived Class that inherits the base class using:
class Derived : public Base
4. Add additional data members or functions to the derived class.
5. In the main() function:
Create an object of the derived class.
Access base class functions through the derived class object.
6. Display the results.
7. Stop the program.


Program :

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
// Base class
class Person {
protected:
    string name;
public:
    void getName() {
        cout << "Enter Name: ";
        cin >> name;
    }
    void showName() {
        cout << "Name: " << name << endl;
    }
};
// Derived class (Single Inheritance)
class Student : public Person {
private:
    int marks;
public:
    void getMarks() {
        cout << "Enter Marks: ";
        cin >> marks;
    }
    void showMarks() {
        cout << "Marks: " << marks << endl;
    }
};
int main() {
    Student s;   // Derived class object
    s.getName();
    s.getMarks();
    cout << "\n--- Student Details ---" << endl;
    s.showName();
    s.showMarks();
    return 0;
}

Sample Output:

Enter Name: Riya
Enter Marks: 85


Result:

Single inheritance in C++ is successfully implemented.
The Student class inherits properties of the Person class, demonstrating how one class can reuse another class’s features
