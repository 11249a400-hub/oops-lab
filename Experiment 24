Experiment 24
Vector Usage and Algorithms in C++


Aim:

To study and implement the usage of vectors in C++ and apply STL algorithms such as sort(), reverse(), and find() on vector elements.

Algorithm:

1. Start the program.
2. Include the header file <vector> for vector operations and <algorithm> for STL algorithms.
3. Declare a vector of integers.
4. Insert elements into the vector using push_back().
5. Display the vector elements.
6. Perform the following STL algorithms:
sort() → to sort the vector
reverse() → to reverse the vector order
find() → to search for an element
7. Display results after each operation.
8. End the program.


Program: 

#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;
int main() {
    vector<int> v;
    // Insert elements
    v.push_back(30);
    v.push_back(10);
    v.push_back(50);
    v.push_back(20);
    v.push_back(40);
    cout << "Original Vector: ";
    for (int x : v)
        cout << x << " ";
    cout << endl;
    // Sorting the vector
    sort(v.begin(), v.end());
    cout << "Sorted Vector: ";
    for (int x : v)
        cout << x << " ";
    cout << endl;
    // Reverse the vector
    reverse(v.begin(), v.end());
    cout << "Reversed Vector: ";
    for (int x : v)
        cout << x << " ";
    cout << endl;
    // Searching an element
    int key = 20;
    auto it = find(v.begin(), v.end(), key);
    if (it != v.end())
        cout << "Element " << key << " found at position "
             << (it - v.begin()) << endl;
    else
        cout << "Element not found" << endl;
    return 0;
}


Output:

Original Vector: 30 10 50 20 40
Sorted Vector: 10 20 30 40 50
Reversed Vector: 50 40 30 20 10
Element 20 found at position 3
