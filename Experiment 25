Experiment 25
Map and Counting Words Using C++


Aim:

To implement a program in C++ that uses an STL map to count the frequency of words in a given text.

Algorithm:

1. Start the program.
2. Include the header file <map> for using map and <sstream> for splitting text into words.
3. Declare a map of type:
map<string, int>
4. Read a sentence or paragraph as input.
5. Use stringstream to separate the sentence into individual words.
6. For each word:
Check if it already exists in the map.
If yes, increase the count.
Otherwise insert it with count = 1.
7. Traverse the map and display each word with its frequency.
8. End the program.


Program: 

#include <iostream>
#include <map>
#include <sstream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
    map<string, int> wordCount;
    string text, word;
    cout << "Enter a sentence: ";
    getline(cin, text);
    stringstream ss(text);
    // Counting words using map
    while (ss >> word) {
        wordCount[word]++;
    }

    // Displaying result
    cout << "\nWord Frequency:\n";
    for (auto &p : wordCount) {
        cout << p.first << " : " << p.second << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}


Sample Input

Enter a sentence: the sky is blue and the sky is wide


Output:

Word Frequency:
and : 1
blue : 1
is : 2
sky : 2
the : 2
wide : 1

Result:

Thus, the program successfully demonstrates how to use an STL map to count the frequency of words in a given text.
The map stores each word as a key and the number of occurrences as its value, showing efficient word-counting using associative containers.
