Experiment 15

To implement the  use of the single public and private inheritance.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Aim:

To write a C++ program to implement single inheritance using public and private inheritance and observe how memberare inherited in each case.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Algorithm:

1. Start the program.
2. Create a base class with:
private members
protected members
public members
3. Create a derived class using:
public inheritance
private inheritance
4. Inside the derived class:
Try accessing base class members and observe which are accessible.
5. Create objects of the derived class.
6. Call functions to show:
What is accessible in public inheritance
What is accessible in private inheritance
7. Display the results.
8. End the program.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Source Code (C++):


#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Base {
private:
    int a;        // Not inherited
protected:
    int b;        // Inherited but not accessible directly in main
public:
    int c;        // Inherited and accessible based on mode

    Base() {
        a = 10;
        b = 20;
        c = 30;
    }

    void showBase() {
        cout << "Base class: a=" << a << " b=" << b << " c=" << c << endl;
    }
};

// ---------- Public Inheritance ----------
class DerivedPublic : public Base {
public:
    void show() {
        // a not accessible
        cout << "DerivedPublic accessing b = " << b << endl;
        cout << "DerivedPublic accessing c = " << c << endl;
    }
};

// ---------- Private Inheritance ----------
class DerivedPrivate : private Base {
public:
    void show() {
        // b and c become private in this class
        cout << "DerivedPrivate accessing b = " << b << endl;
        cout << "DerivedPrivate accessing c = " << c << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    DerivedPublic dp;
    DerivedPrivate dpr;

    cout << "----- Public Inheritance -----" << endl;
    dp.show();        // b & c accessible
    cout << "Accessing public member c from object = " << dp.c << endl;

    cout << "\n----- Private Inheritance -----" << endl;
    dpr.show();       // Allowed through function
    // dpr.c; // ❌ Not allowed (private)

    return 0;
}
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Output

----- Public Inheritance -----
DerivedPublic accessing b = 20
DerivedPublic accessing c = 30
Accessing public member c from object = 30

----- Private Inheritance -----
DerivedPrivate accessing b = 20
DerivedPrivate accessing c = 30
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Result

The program successfully demonstrates single inheritance in two modes:



public and protected members of Base → become private in DerivedPrivate

Cannot be accessed from an object of the derived class.


Thus, the behavior of inheritance changes based on the mode used.
